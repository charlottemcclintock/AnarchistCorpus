# AnarchistCorpus

web scraping texts from the Anarchist Library for some natural language processing exploration

thanks to the Anarchist Library ([theanarchistlibrary.org/](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index)) for compiling texts and having an incredible well organized site!

## ideas:

- [x] tf-idf - what words are most significant in a given text?
- [x] LDA - what topic clusters can I find across documents?
- [x] recommendation engine based on tf-idf
- [x] NER - what entities appear most often? who or what is being talked about
- [ ] sentiment analysis - look at 10 most + and - docs overall
- [ ] all code to classes/methods?
- [ ] parallelize code to run faster?
